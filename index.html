                <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                A self-motivated aspiring web developer with a knack for transforming ideas into user-friendly, pixel-perfect websites. I code with passion, weaving together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft dynamic experiences that captivate and engage. A firm believer in clean, collaborative code, I thrive in environments where we learn, grow, and build amazing things together. My portfolio may be young, but my enthusiasm and dedication to excellence speak volumes. Let's build something remarkable, one line of code at a time.

                <img src=".jpg files/html5.webp" alt="HTML" title="HTML"/>
                <p>HTML is the foundation of all websites, structuring content using elements like headings, paragraphs, and lists. It's not a programming language, but a markup language using tags to define elements. Tags like create titles, paragraphs, and lists.</p>

                <img src=".jpg files/css.webp" alt="CSS" title="CSS"/>
                <p>CSS is the visual stylist for websites, controlling colors, fonts, layouts, and more. It pairs with HTML, adding design flair and visual appeal to the structured content. Think of it as the interior decorator bringing life to the house's blueprint.</p>

                <p>JavaScript is the magic that brings websites to life, adding interactivity, animations, and dynamic updates. It's the script that makes elements move, react, and respond, creating engaging experiences for users. Think of it as the electricity powering the house's appliances.</p>

            <div class="card" id="card3">
                <img src=".jpg files/Bootstrap.png" alt="Bootstrap" title="Bootstrap"/>
                <p>Bootstrap isn't a language, but a pre-made library of web design tools. Imagine it as a toolbox full of ready-made styles, buttons, grids, and layouts. Developers grab these tools to quickly build responsive, mobile-friendly web pages without starting from scratch.</p>
